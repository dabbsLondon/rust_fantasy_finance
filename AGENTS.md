# Instructions for AI Agents

- Always run `cargo test` before committing. Continuous integration depends on it.
- Docker images pushed by GitHub Actions are tagged using the package version.
  Images for the `main` branch use `0.0.0` style tags while other branches use
  `0.0.0_branchname` (branch lowercased).
